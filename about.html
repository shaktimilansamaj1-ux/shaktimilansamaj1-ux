                            <p>Shakti Milan Samaj (SMS) was born from the courage, pain, and resilience of three women
                                who were
                                trafficked, rescued, and living with HIV. In 1996, in the heart of Kathmandu, they came
                                together not
                                just as survivors, but as changemakers determined to rewrite the story for women like
                                themselves.
                                They had faced the harshest realities: exploitation, stigma, and rejection from both
                                society and
                                their own families. But instead of succumbing to silence, they chose solidarity. </p>
                            <P>What started as a small, informal support group has now grown into a powerful,
                                apolitical, non-profit
                                organization led by and for women living with HIV/AIDS, survivors of trafficking, and
                                victims of
                                gender-based violence. Our roots lie in lived experience and this remains our strength.
                                We know what
                                it
                                means to be denied dignity, safety, and care, which is why we fight every day to ensure
                                others do
                                not
                                have to walk the same path alone.</P>
                            <p>Today, SMS stands as a national voice advocating for the rights, health, and empowerment
                                of the most
                                marginalized women and children in Nepal. From providing essential healthcare and
                                psychosocial
                                support,
                                to rescuing trafficked women and advocating for systemic change, our journey continues
                                driven by
                                empathy, resilience, and an unshakable commitment to justice. Our story is one of
                                survival—but more
                                importantly, it is one of transformation.</p>
